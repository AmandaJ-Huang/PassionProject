# **Passion Project: Find Me a Board Game!**

Find Me a Board Game! is an app for helping users pick a tabletop game (i.e., board games, card games, dice games, etc.) based on their interests. The user can select from various filters such as genre, play time, number of players and vice versa, to find the best game for their next get-together. After inputting all desired filters, the app will provide users with a list of 10 games that most closely match their selection. The list will include a ranking from 1-10 (from best or most relevant), a picture of the game, and a brief overview. If users aren't sure what filters to apply, they can also click the randomize button.

Users can register an account where they will provide a username, password, and indicate if they are new or experienced players. In account settings, users can add to (via a drop down search box) or remove from (via a red `-` button) a list of owned games. This can be factored into their search, in case the user wants to be recommended only non-owned games or not. New players will also be given a preset list of 10 low complexity, but highly rated, games.

I will make this app using Angular, Java/Spring Boot, Sql Database.
