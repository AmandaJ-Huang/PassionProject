# **Passion Project: Find a Table Topper**

Find a Table Topper is an app for helping users pick a tabletop game (i.e., board games, card games, dice games, etc.) based on their interests. The user can select from various filters such as difficulty, play time, number of players and vice versa, to find the best game for their next get-together. After inputting all desired filters, the app will provide users with a list of 10 games that most closely match their selection. The list will include a ranking from 1-10 (from best or most relevant), a picture of the game, and a brief overview. 

Users can also register an account and add any games they already own. This can be factored into their search, in case the user wants to be recommended a new game or not.

I will make this site using Angular (front-end), SQL DB (middle), Java and Spring (back-end), and Heroku (app hosting).
